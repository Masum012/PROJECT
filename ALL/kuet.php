					<p style="margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;text-align:left; ">Khulna University of Engineering & Technology (KUET) is situated at Fulbarigate,
					the North-West part of the Khulna City,
					which is the third largest south-western divisional city in Bangladesh.</p>
					<p style="margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;text-align:left;">The Institute campus is about 15 (fifteen) kilometers 
					away from the zero point of Khulna City, which is well-connected to the major city centers by open and 
					wide roads. It is located at about 12 (twelve) kilometers away from the 
					Inter-District Bus Terminal and approximately 14 (fourteen) kilometers from the Khulna Railway Station.</p>
					<p style="margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;text-align:left;">The Institute campus covers an area of 100 acres. It is divided 
					into four functional zones: (i) Residential zone for the students, (ii) Residential zone for the faculties
					and staffs, (iii) Academic zone for the academic buildings & workshops, and (iv) Cultural-cum-social and 
					recreational zone for the students. Being square in-shape, the third zone has been
					located at mid-way between the two residential zones in order to reduce the walking distances.</p>
					<p style="margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px;text-align:left;">The main academic building accommodates the different
					teaching and research facilities. However, each department is a separate entity with a courtyard 
					around and all the departments constitute an integrated complex. Heavy Engineering Laboratories
					are positioned on the ground floor or other separate workshops. While light Laboratories, classrooms
					and project rooms are located on the upper floors. Separate offices have been provided to every 
					member of the teaching staffs next to his/her laboratory. Large lecture theatres with the modern
					accessories and equipments for sound and projection are located in the courtyards between departments
					for common use. The campus also offers facilities like Teachers and Staff Clubs, Medical Center, 
					Departmental Store, Bank with ATM Booth, Post Office and Playground etc. The Centre of coordinating 
					the Students Welfare Activities provides all
					sorts of extra-curricular facilities to the students for their mental and physical development.</p>
